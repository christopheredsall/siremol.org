## Seeing the changes (diffing)

Git is always looking to see what has changed in your working directory. Git can tell you what has changed by using the `git diff` command, e.g. type

```
git diff
```

You should see that nothing is printed, because, at the moment, nothing has changed since the last commit.

So, let us now make a change. Open up the file `README.md` and fix the error that we made in the text. Change the line that reads

```
will say that the cat goes woof.
```

to read

```
will say that the cat goes meow.
```

Save and exit from the text editor, and then use the `git status` command to see if Git knows about this change. You should see output similar to

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The important line here is `modified: README.md`. This shows that git knows that the `README.md` file has been changed. To see what the change is, type the command

```
git diff
```

You should see output similar to this

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 6c72b9d..1abd0a1 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -6,5 +6,5 @@ We will use Git to record all of the versions of this file,
 letting us move back and forth through time.
 
 For example, in this first version of the file we
-will say that the cat goes woof.
+will say that the cat goes meow.
```

(note that, if you are lucky, you should see all of the above in different colours. If you donâ€™t see different colours, then type `git config --global color.diff auto` and then run `git diff` again).

What this (overcomplicated) output shows, is that git knows that the file `README.md` has changed, with the line will say that `the cat goes woof.` being removed (indicated by the `-` sign), and the line will say that `the cat goes meow.` has been added (indicated by the `+` sign).

By default, `git diff` will show you all of the changes that have occurred since the last commit in all of the files in the version controlled directory (which we also call *the working directory*). You can limit the output to only a specific file by using `git diff FILENAME`, e.g. type

```
git diff README.md
```

which should show you the changes in `README.md`. Now type

```
git diff something.md
```

Should print no output, because something.md has not changed since the last commit.


## Reverting a change

Maybe you don't want to save this change? Remember, the old version of the file is safely saved in git. We can 
revert back to the old version of `README.md` by using the command `git checkout`. Typing `git checkout main FILENAME`
will revert back to the last saved version of `FILENAME`. Let's revert back to our original `README.md`. Type;

```
git checkout main README.md
```

Run `git status` again. You should now see that the working tree is clean, and `README.md` has been 
reverted back to the old version, where the `cat goes woof`.

Let's now change `README.md` again. You are free to either fix the file to make the `dog goes woof` or
the `cat goes meow` (it's your choice ;-)).

## Saving the change

Once you've fixed the file, you will need to commit the change using `git commit -a` and add a suitable
commit message. For example, I will make the `cat goes meow` and will use this commit message;

```
Fixing a typo in README.md. Cats do not go woof.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
```

When I save and exit from the text editor I see this output from git. You should see something
similar (but not identical)

```
[main 3bdce37] Fixing a typo in README.md. Cats do not go woof.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Git Cheat Sheet

We have two new commands, `git diff` for printing differences, and `git checkout` 
for reverting files.

```
Git Cheat Sheet

(1)  git init             : Tell git to start version controlling the files in a directory
                            (initialises git in a directory)
(2)  git status           : Tell git to print the status of the files in the version 
                            controlled directory.
(3)  git add              : Tell git to start monitoring (tracking) the versions of a new
                            file, e.g. `git add README.md` will tell git to track `README.md`   
(4)  git commit -a        : Tell git to save a new snapshot version of all of the tracked
                            files in the directory. The `-a` means "all files". You can
                            commit new versions of individual files if you want, but this
                            is not recommended.
(5)  git diff             : Tell git to show the differences between the files in the working
                            directory and the last saved version in the git repository. This will
                            show the differences for all tracked files. Use
                            `git diff FILENAME` to limit to only the file `FILENAME`
(6) git checkout main FILENAME : Tell git to revert a file back to the last version of `FILENAME` 
                                 saved in the repository
```

## Exercise

Edit your file called `something.md`. Make some changes to the text (e.g. adding some new lines, or changing some words).

Use `git status`. Does git know that you have changed `something.md`?

Use `git diff`. Does git correctly find all of your changes?

Use `git diff README.md`. Does git know that nothing has changed with `README.md`?

Use `git checkout something.md` to revert the file back to the last saved version. Has this correctly
restored the old version of the file?

Make some more changes to `something.md`.

Use `git commit -a` to commit your changes, ensuring that you write a good commit message. Does `git diff` now give you no changes? Does `git status` now show that your working directory is clean?
