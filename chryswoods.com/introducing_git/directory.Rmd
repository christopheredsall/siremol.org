## Creating a version controlled directory

Git is a tool that is used to version control a *directory of files*. To start, we
must first create a directory that will contain the files that will be version controlled.

You can call the directory anything you want. For this workshop, we will call
the directory `versioned_dir`. To create this, type into the command window;

```
mkdir versioned_dir
```

(note that we used an underscore in the directory name, e.g. `versioned_dir`
instead of `versioned dir`. Don't use spaces in directory names as this makes
it harder for the command window to intepret the commands you will type)

This will have created a new directory called `versioned_dir`. We now need to change 
into this directory. Please do that by typing this into the command window;

```
cd versioned_dir
```

This will have changed into our new, empty directory. To check that this is empty,
we will list the contents of the directory. Do that by typing;

```
ls
```

You should see that nothing is printed to the screen.

## Initialising version control

The next step is to tell git that we want to start version controlling the files in this
directory. We do that by initialise git using the `git init` command. Type this into the 
command window;

```
git init
```

You should see something like this printed as output to the screen;

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/chris/versioned_dir/.git/
```

This has told git to initialise a new [repository](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/repository) in which versions of files in this directory will be saved. This repository
is empty, as we have not yet saved any versions.

(note, `repository` is a lesser-used English word that means "a place in which things
may be stored")

## Git Cheat Sheet

This is the first git command that you need to know. There are only a very small number (<10)
of git commands you need to be proficient in git. To help you learn them, we will
build up a Git Cheat Sheet through this workshop. Open a document on your desktop called
"git cheat sheet" and add into it our first git command :-)

```

(1)  git init  : Tell git to start version controlling the files in a directory
                 (initialises git in a directory)
