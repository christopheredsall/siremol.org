## Installing Git

Git is open source, free, and is available for easy installation on a range of operating systems,
including Windows, macOS and Linux.

You will need to have installed the command line version control tool "git". 
The instructions below tell you how to install it on each of these platforms.

### Windows

Please install git (which can be downloaded for free) by downloading an
[installer from here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (this is from
the [official git website](https://git-scm.com)). 

Once you have downloaded the installer, double click on the downloaded file to 
execute it. This will start the installation process. Follow the instructions
of the installer (click "Next" to accept the license etc.). 

Make sure that everything associated with `Git Bash` is enabled, and
"Use Git from Git Bash only" is selected. This is the safest choice, as it will
install a `Git Bash` command window, which will have everything set up for 
running Git. We will use `Git Bash` in this workshop.

To start the program you need to find `Git Bash`. When you start `Git Bash` it will
open a command window in which you can type commands. 

All of these instructions are demonstrated on this (external) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmbAn2_5uGs). 

### Linux

Please install Git using your package manager, e.g. following the 
[instructions here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

The exact command you type will depend on your Linux distribution. Typically,
the command will look like `apt-get install git`, or `yum install git`, 
or `dnf install git`.

If you prefer to build and install from source, there are tarballs available
on [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/).

### macOS

On macOS, you have several choices for how you install git.

1. You can use the git that is installed as part of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
(Apple's free development environment that is supplied as a separate download
for macOS). The best way to install this is via [Xcode on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Note that Xcode is a very large download, and installation will take a while.

2. Install git by going to the [official git website](https://git-scm.com/download) and 
choose macOS. There are instructions here to install via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
(via `brew install git`) or links to download a [binary installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/).

## Starting Git and choosing a text editor

Once you have installed git, you now need to start a command window. On Windows, you do this by starting `Git Bash`.
On Linux or macOS you need to open a command window (e.g. also called a "terminal", "bash window", "console").

We will be using the command window for this workshop. It provides the quickest way to use git. More
importantly, you will learn how git works. There are a very small number of git commands. Once you've learned
them, it makes it much easier to use and understanding what a graphical git interface is doing.

We will be using a very small number of commands in the command window;

* `mkdir` : this means "make directory", and is how we will create a new directory
* `cd` : this means "change directory", and is how we will change directory
* `ls` : this means "list", and will list the contents of a directory

We will also need to use a text editor. A text editor is a program that lets you create and edit
simple text files. There are many different text editors available. You are free to choose
the one you like the best. Commonly-installed text editors include;

* [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) - this is a good text editor for beginners (and my favorite and
personal choice). It should be installed by default on Linux, macOS and Git Bash on Windows
(instructions for [installing it in Git Bash are here](https://coderwall.com/p/ee-law/use-nano-from-git-bash-on-windows-d) if it isn't available). On Linux,
if nano isn't available, then a similar program called `pico` likely is.

* [vim](https://www.vim.org) - this is a standard text editor that is installed nearly everywhere,
and is definitely available on all platforms (or, if not, then the less powerful alternative, called
`vi` is available). This is a more complex text editor to use, and is not recommended for beginners.

* [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) - this is a graphic text editor for Windows. This is
very easy for beginners to use, but is not available for macOS or Linux.
