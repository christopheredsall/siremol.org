In addition to being a great tool for versioning files, Git is a powerful collaboration platform for sharing and working on documents as part of a team. This workshop, which builds on 
[Introducing Git](https://chryswoods.com/introducing_git), will teach you how to use the collaboration
tools built into Git and GitHub to work collaboratively with others.

Please feel free to work through this workshop at your own pace. Git is best learned by using it, so
please copy out and play with the examples provided, and have a go at the exercises. Throughout this
workshop you will extend your "cheat sheet" of Git commands. These are summarised on the 
[summary](summary.html) page.
