```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Lists let you store lots of variables, and to access them by their location 
in the list. However, there are times when you want to store lots of variables, 
but access them using more complex relationships. One example is a dictionary, 
which lets you store variables and access them using a key.

Dictionaries in R are created by associating names (keys) with elements
in a list. You thus create them using the same combine (`c`) function 
as used to create a list.  Make a new file called `dict.R` and put this in it:

```R
sounds <- c("cat"="meow", "dog"="woof", "horse"="neigh")

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(cat_sound)
```

Running that script, you should see 

```   
cat 
"meow" 
```

printed to the screen.

What we did here was create a dictionary by adding names (keys) to the items
in the list. The three items in the list are `meow`, `woof` and `neigh`. We have
added names (keys) using the syntax `name=value`, so `meow` is given the name `cat`,
`woof` is named `dog` and `neigh` is named `horse`.

The value is the real data that we want to keep hold of and the name (also called key) 
is how we can get at the data we want. The key and value are separated by an
equals sign, and each key-value pair is separated by a comma.

On the next line we access the data in the dictionary sounds. Again, 
like lists we use the square brackets to ask questions of our data. In 
this case we're asking the dictionary to give us the value associated with 
the key `cat` and so it will return to us `meow`.

Since dictionaries can be quite large and it can sometimes be hard to see 
which parts are keys and which are values, it is possible to write 
dictionaries over multiple lines, one line per key-value item:

```R
sounds <- c(
  "cat"="meow", 
  "dog"="woof", 
  "horse"="neigh"
)

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(cat_sound)
```

Note that an R dictionary is just a list with named elements. This means you
can still access the items by index, e.g. `sounds[1]` will return `cat`.
This also means that you don't need to name every element!

Also note that 

```
cat
"meow"
```

was printed to the screen as the value with its name (key) is returned.
To get the value alone, you need to use `as.character` if the value
is a string, or `as.numeric` if the value is a number, e.g.

```R
sounds <- c(
  "cat"="meow",
  "dog"="woof",
  "horse"="neigh"
)

cat_sound <- sounds["cat"]

print(as.character(cat_sound))
```

would print

```
[1] "meow"
```
